		<h2>Augmented Reality Caterpillar</h2>
		<!-- Change the image name below to match what you have dropped into the image folder -->
		<img src="images/unit2_augmented.jpg" />
		<!-- Change the description below and add something about your project -->
		<p>This is a Great Sphinx caterpillar which is about 5 to 6 inches long and loves frangipani leaves. They absolutely freak me out. Even though this was done like an 8-bit image, I didn't expect it to look so realistic. My sons love it and currently have it displayed walking up a lamp in the living room =O</p>

		<h2>Upcycled Tray</h2>
		<!-- Change the image name below to match what you have dropped into the image folder -->
		<img src="images/unit4_upcycled.jpg" />
		<!-- Change the description below and add something about your project -->
		<p>I found an old, wooden, unfinished tray in a thrift store to use for this project. It cost $1.18. I sanded it to clean it up, then spray-painted part of a favourite quote on it. It references how my home is always a haven and I feel comforted thinking about that.</p>

		<h2>3D Model Character from Dukat</h2>
		<!-- Change the image name below to match what you have dropped into the image folder -->
		<img src="images/unit5_3dmodel.jpg" />
		<!-- Change the description below and add something about your project -->
		<p>I really liked the idea of creating a character of my own from scratch. I was surprised at how easy it was to use the 3D modelling software. This is Macet Darem from the planet Dukat also known on Earth as the exoplanet Gliese 163c. I used an actual exoplanet and invented an environment and life for Macet.</p>

		<h2>Bob Ross Inspired Landscape</h2>
		<!-- Change the image name below to match what you have dropped into the image folder -->
		<img src="images/unit7_bobross.jpg" />
		<!-- Change the description below and add something about your project -->
		<p>I think I have watched almost every single episode of Bob Ross. I even have a list of my favourite episodes. In spite of that, I have never actually painted along with him.  This is the first time I have consciously "painted" a Ross-like landscape. I am now inspired to try others.</p>

		<h2>Exquisite Corpse Middle</h2>
		<!-- Change the image name below to match what you have dropped into the image folder -->
		<img src="images/unit9_exquisite.jpg" />
		<!-- Change the description below and add something about your project -->
		<p>This is a middle section for the exquisite corpse exercise.  I started with images of fields of flowers, even turned a couple of them upside down, and experimented with a lot of colour adjustments and filters in Photoshop to create this piece.</p>

		<h2>Lost Pet Poster</h2>
		<!-- Change the image name below to match what you have dropped into the image folder -->
		<img src="images/unit10_lostpet.jpg" />
		<!-- Change the description below and add something about your project -->
		<p>To create Flossie I combined a cockatoo and a polar bear because they were similar in colour. I used colours from the bear's body and the 'fur' brush to hide where they were joined and also to create more shadows on the head which was brighter than the body.</p>

		<h2>Lightning Storm</h2>
		<!-- Change the image name below to match what you have dropped into the image folder -->
		<img src="images/unit11_2Danimation.gif" />
		<!-- Change the description below and add something about your project -->
		<p>This is the first 2D animation I have ever created and it was much easier than I thought. I enjoyed the process and hope to get more comfortable some day doing actual drawings on the computer.</p>

		<!-- Change the project name below -->
		<h2>Video with 2D Animation</h2>
		<!-- Change the image name below to match what you have dropped into the image folder -->
		<img src="images/unit12_animatedvideo.gif" />
		<!-- Change the description below and add something about your project -->
		<p>I used about 50 frames to create this animation because I was trying to get the movement of my floating blob as smooth as possible.  I also experimented with different time delays so that his movement was similar to the movement of the waves.  I used Photoshop for this video but I also checked out Blender and Gimp to compare their capabilities so that I can try them out with future work.</p>
